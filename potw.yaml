    Tone is very important in the East African language Maasai. Vowels written with an acúte accent have high tone, those with a gràve accent have low tone, and those without an accent have mid tone.

    (Pronunciation guide: 
    ɔ = "awe"
    ɛ = "let"
    ɪ = "bit"
    ʊ = "hood"
    ŋ = "song")

    Here are some sentences in Maasai: 

    1) éósh ɔlmʊraní ɔlásʊráɪ̀
    2) áadɔ́l ɔlasʊráɪ́
    3) áaósh ɔlmʊraní
    4) ɪ́dɔ́l ɔlmʊránì
