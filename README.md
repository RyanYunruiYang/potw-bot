# potw-bot

1. Send out the ongoing potw, with tagged subjects
2. Allow users to submit answers to problems (short answers will be graded automatically; long answers such as proofs will be sent to mods for review)
    1. Include ability for sub-question answers
    2. Should we allow multiple submissions or would that encourage brute forcing
3. Don’t allow people with the subject role to submit answers to those department problems (optional, since this will mean that all answers will need to be submitted through the server rather than dm’s)
4. Award points for each user and update the leaderboard
5. Allow users to submit problem proposals & keep a queue of all current proposals
6. Allow mods to make manual changes to the point value of a potw, which will then change all previous submitted answers’ points and adjust the leaderboard
